## Project Description

This is my final project in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
This was the most complex project bacuse I had to use all of my skills and knew knowledge which I learnt during the program.
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for this project and try to do my best. :) 

The app provides a list of my favorite places in Budapest (Hungary) where I live, and displays their location marker on a map generated by the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/). When a locations name is clicked, an infoWindow displays more detailed information about the place, and I also used Foursquare API in order to get datas about my places.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
